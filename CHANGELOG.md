## 7.0.0

### ApiResourceDocumentationElement (former api-endpoint-documentation)

The `api-resource-document` element has the following properties changes compared to deprecated `api-endpoint-documentation`

- `noTryIt` is renamed to `tryItButton`. When `tryItButton` is set then the try it button in operations is rendered.
- `noUrlEditor` is now renamed to `urlEditor`. When `urlEditor` is set then the HTTP request editor renders the URL editor input field.
